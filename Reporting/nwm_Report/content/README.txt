This folder should contain each of the separate documents to be compiled together with the "main.tex" document in the parent folder.

I will use the following conventions for naming these individual files.

"reportSection_sectionName"

Examples:

ch_Introduction.tex
ch_Modellings.tex
ch_Results.tex

 --> these are all chapters, named "Introduction", "Modelling" and "Results"

app_Scraping.tex
app_Parsing.tex

 --> these are appendices, names "Scraping" and "Parsing"



It might be sensible to create separate files for other sections; these should follow a comparable extension
