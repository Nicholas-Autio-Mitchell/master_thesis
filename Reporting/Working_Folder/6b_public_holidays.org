* Appendix 2 - Public holidays <<pub-holidays>>


** DONE Remark: Nikkei 225

An additional feature of the data sourced from [[http://markets.on.nytimes.com/research/markets/holidays/holidays.asp?display%3Dmarket&timeOffset%3D-1&exchange%3DTYO][Japan]] should be mentioned. The Nikkei 225 stock index data was used, which had a missing data point for the very first day of the timeline, 14^th January 2013. In order to perform the selected method of imputation - last observation carried forward (LOCF) - it was therefore necessary to source the data from the most closely preceding trading day, in order to impute the missing first day.


** DONE North America

Table [[tab:public-holidays]] summarises public holidays relevant to the timeline and so the data used in this study is presented. The public holidays listed give the dates, which were used a dummy variables in the modelling. The dummy variable took the value 1 for a public holiday and 0 for not a public holiday.
