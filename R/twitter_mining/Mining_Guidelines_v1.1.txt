1)Ensure all required packages are installed and loaded into session:
  - twitteR
  - base64enc
  - tm
  - plyr
  - ...
  
2) Probably only needs to be done once, but the Twitter API needs to be established.
  - Create a text file containing the four required values: "consumer_key", "consumer_secret", "access_token" and  "access_token_secret".
  - Use the functions 'setup_twitter_oauth()' using the four saved values and the function inputs (only these four are required). After being prompted, select [1] to use a local file cache for direct access.
  - If problems occur this is likely due to updates to the twitteR package itself or to its dependiencies. Check the Github website of the twitteR creator: Jeff Gentry <geoffjentry@gmail.com>.
  
3) Start to import some tweets using the function: 'searchTwitter()'. See the function help pages for assistance with the input.

4) Inported tweets using the above function are stored in a (large) list. This needs to be converted into a string/character vector or something similar to allow the manipulation of the tweets themselves - packages such as 'tm' do this well.

5) The function 'sapply()' will parse the list we have save from Twitter and return a character vector, so all text is retained, but can now be mor easily manipulated. We would like to create a corpus (a collection of objects/documents, in our case they are simply individual tweets)

6) We no should begin to clean the tweets saved individually within our corpus. A general cleaning process can be completed, followed by one tailored to the specific analysis that will subsequently be carried out on the tweets.

The general cleaning process may remove less usual content from the tweets, such as: punctuation, numbers, URLs, the distinction between upper and lower case (i.e. make everything lower case), and also remove common words such as 'and' 'of' 'also' etc.

The more specific cleaning may involve removing words that are known to be irrelavant to the analysis, however are expteced to appear very ofter within the tweets.

7) We form a corpus from our character vector by using the function 'Corpus()'.


## A list displaying the possible queries as strings into the searchTwitter function (for multiple search terms)
"#Obamacare" 	                will find tweets containing the hashtag "Obamacare"
"@BarackObama" 	              will find tweets referencing Barack Obama's account
"ACA until:2014-08-22" 	      will find tweets containing "ACA" and sent before 2010-08-25
"from:BarackObama" 	          will find tweets sent from Barack Obama
"Obamacare -ACA" 	            will find tweets containing "Obamacare" but not "ACA
"Obamacare ACA" 	            will find tweets containing both "Obamacare" and "ACA"; not case sensitive
"Obamacare ACA" 	            will find tweets containing the exact phrase "Obamacare ACA"; not case sensitive
"Obamacare OR ACA" 	          will find tweets containing either "Obamacare" or "ACA" or both; not case sensitive; the OR operator IS case sensitive.
"Obamacare since:2014-08-25" 	will find tweets containing "Obamacare" and sent since 2010-08-25 (year-month-day)
